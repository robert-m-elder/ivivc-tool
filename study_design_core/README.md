# Study-design numerical foundation

`study_design_core` is a presentation-independent layer for the planned
degradation study-design assessment module. It does not change the existing
IVIVC browser or CLI behavior.

## Common reference representation

All sources of expected in vivo behavior are converted to a
`ReferenceTrajectoryEnsemble`:

- one strictly increasing in vivo time grid;
- one complete response trajectory per plausible draw;
- validity flags and normalized draw weights;
- a central reference curve;
- the shared supported time range.

`reference_from_trajectory_ensemble()` converts the joint time/response draws
produced by `ivivc_core`. It sorts each draw, removes nonfinite pairs, handles
duplicate times according to an explicit policy, restricts the result to the
intersection of the valid draw domains, and does not extrapolate.

`reference_from_profile_fit()` supports a fitted measured in vivo profile, and
`reference_from_time_course()` supports a deterministic external trajectory.

## Future-study variability

`ObservationModel` is separate from uncertainty in the reference trajectory.
The initial supported forms are constant absolute SD and constant coefficient
of variation. `observation_model_from_residuals()` can create a clearly labeled
residual-based surrogate from an existing `ProfileFit`; it can include both
measurement variability and model lack of fit.

## User constraints

`DesignConstraints` records candidate times, already fixed times, time range,
minimum spacing, allowable numbers of distinct times, and fixed replicates per
time. These are user-defined numerical constraints, not standards or regulatory
requirements.

## Repeated fitting

`fit_model_once()` fits one registered model without cross-validation, metrics,
plots, or HTML. It is intended for Monte Carlo study simulations. A caller can
supply reference parameters directly; model-specific starts are used when
available, and generic grid search can be requested or used once as a fallback.

The later optimization and simulation modules should consume these objects
rather than legacy IVIVC dictionaries.

## Information-based time-point optimization

Patch 8 adds a prediction-oriented information layer. A reference trajectory
ensemble is first represented by the selected analysis model:

```python
from study_design_core import fit_reference_model_ensemble

reference_model = fit_reference_model_ensemble(
    reference,
    model_name='stretched_exponential',
)
```

Each successful fit produces one complete parameter draw with the source draw's
weight. The optimizer then uses finite-difference model sensitivities and the
future-study observation model to calculate local Fisher-information matrices.
The default criterion is uncertainty-averaged I-optimality: integrated fitted
mean-curve variance over a user-specified evaluation grid.

```python
from study_design_core import (
    DesignConstraints,
    ObservationModel,
    optimize_i_optimal_designs,
)

constraints = DesignConstraints(
    candidate_times=np.arange(0.0, 53.0),
    fixed_times=np.array([0.0]),
    min_number_of_times=4,
    max_number_of_times=8,
    minimum_spacing=2.0,
    replicates_per_time=4,
)
observation = ObservationModel(kind='constant_cv', value=0.10, minimum_sd=0.01)
result = optimize_i_optimal_designs(
    reference_model,
    observation,
    constraints,
    refine=True,
)
```

The greedy sequence is nested. Before a design is full rank, selection is based
on robust rank and pseudo-determinant diagnostics; after full rank is attained,
selection minimizes the uncertainty-averaged I criterion. Optional coordinate
exchange refines each design size without preserving nesting. These information
scores are screening and optimization quantities; later Monte Carlo validation
will provide user-facing expected recovery performance.
